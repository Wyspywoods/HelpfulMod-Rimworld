	<description>A small mod that tweaks vanilla torches and lamps, adds four lights, glass walls, and advanced sandbag fortifications. Two of the lights are gated behind solar power technology and while expensive, require no power.  An impromptu mod made in response to community requests using assets that i've been using in my own game for some time.</description>
